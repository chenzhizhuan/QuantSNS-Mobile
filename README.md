**QuantDinger Mobile** is the official mobile and lightweight web client for the [QuantDinger](https://github.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger) quantitative platform, a product of **Open Byte Inc**. It is built with **Vue 3**, **Vite**, and **Capacitor 6**, and ships as **Android** and **iOS** native shells around the same web app you can also host as **standalone H5**. Connect it to your self-hosted stack or to the hosted service by pointing the app at a QuantDinger-compatible API base URL.

This repository is licensed under the same **source-available** terms as the [QuantDinger-Vue](https://github.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger-Vue) desktop frontend. See [License](#license) below and the [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) file for the full text.

## Why this client exists

QuantDinger’s main operator experience is a rich **desktop web** application. This project delivers a **touch-first, narrow-screen** experience for the same backend: watchlists, strategies, notifications, settings, AI-assisted flows, and trading-related views where implemented. You run one backend (or use the hosted one) and choose **desktop web**, **mobile native**, or **mobile H5** as the front door.

---

## What you can do

- Browse markets and manage watchlists (subject to backend capabilities).
- Inspect and control strategies, notifications, and account-oriented screens as exposed by the API.
- Switch **API base URL** in settings so a single build can target **dev**, **LAN**, **production**, or **SaaS**.
- Ship **Capacitor** wrappers for **Google Play** / sideloaded APK and **Apple** distribution workflows.
- Deploy the same `dist/` output as **SPA** behind Nginx (or similar) for a mobile web site.

Exact feature coverage evolves with the platform; treat the running app against your backend as the source of truth.

---

## How it talks to the backend

The client stores a **server base URL** (origin only, no path suffix). All REST calls use that origin plus routes such as `/api/health`, `/api/...`. A successful **Settings → Test connection** check hits `{base}/api/health`.

The default compiled default is defined in `src/config/index.js` (`DEFAULT_SERVER_URL`). Users override it in the UI; the value is persisted locally (e.g. `localStorage`).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20.19+ or 22.12+ (Node 22 LTS recommended). Vite 7 will fail on Node 18 with errors such as `crypto.hash is not a function`.
- **npm** (or compatible client) for installing dependencies.
- **Android Studio** and an Android SDK when building or debugging Android.
- **macOS**, **Xcode**, and an **Apple Developer** account for device deployment and App Store–style distribution.

---

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger-Mobile.git
cd QuantDinger-Mobile
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server is the H5 experience. The Android project is committed in `android/`; sync native assets after a production build:

```bash
npx cap add ios        # first time only, on macOS
npm run build
npx cap sync
```

---

## Docker one-click deployment

The main QuantDinger Docker Compose stack now includes the mobile H5 service. Install the full stack from the main repo and open the mobile client at **`http://localhost:8889`**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger/main/install.sh | bash
```

When visiting from a phone, use the host machine's LAN IP, for example `http://192.168.1.10:8889`. The container proxies `/api` to the same backend service, so the H5 client can work without manual server URL setup in the default Compose deployment.

Image tag and port can be overridden in the main repo `.env`:

```ini
IMAGE_TAG=4.0.3
MOBILE_TAG=4.0.3
MOBILE_PORT=8889
# Only needed when running the mobile image outside the main Compose stack.
# In the default stack this stays http://backend:5000. Do not change it.
# Only override it when your backend container uses a custom name, for example:
# BACKEND_URL=http://quantdinger_api:5000
# Docker Desktop backend running on the host:
# BACKEND_URL=http://host.docker.internal:5000
```

---

## npm scripts

| Script            | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| `npm run dev`     | Start Vite dev server (H5). |
| `npm run build`   | Production build to `dist/`. |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally. |
| `npm run cap:sync` | Copy web assets into native projects. |
| `npm run cap:android` | Open the Android project in Android Studio. |
| `npm run cap:ios` | Open the iOS project in Xcode (macOS). |
| `npm run build:android` | `build` + sync Android. |
| `npm run build:ios` | `build` + sync iOS. |
| `npm run build:all` | `build` + sync all configured platforms. |

---

## Configuring the API base URL

Enter the **origin** your browser or WebView can reach, **without** a trailing slash. Examples:

| Scenario | Example base URL |
|----------|------------------|
| Nginx serves SPA and proxies `/api` to the backend | `https://m.example.com` |
| LAN Docker-style web on port 8888 | `http://192.168.1.10:8888` |
| Backend API only (CORS must allow the app origin) | `http://192.168.1.10:5000` |

After changing the URL, use **Test connection** in settings. If health checks fail, verify TLS, firewall, and that the backend is listening on the host and port you expect.

### Which setting should I change?

| Runtime | How to point it at your backend |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| Main QuantDinger Docker stack | Usually change nothing. The mobile container serves H5 on `MOBILE_PORT` and proxies `/api` to the backend service. |
| Mobile Docker image by itself | By default it looks for `backend:5000` on the same Docker network. If your backend container has a custom name, pass `-e BACKEND_URL=http://your-backend-container:5000`; use `-e BACKEND_URL=http://host.docker.internal:5000` when the backend runs on the Docker Desktop host. This controls the Nginx `/api/` proxy inside the container. |
| `npm run dev` H5 development | Set `VITE_DEV_API_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:5000` before starting Vite. Browser requests will still look like `/api/...` on the dev server because Vite proxies them. |
| Static H5 behind your own Nginx | Prefer same-origin proxy: serve the app at `https://m.example.com` and proxy `https://m.example.com/api/` to the backend. |
| Native Android/iOS shell | Open app settings and set the server URL to an address the phone can reach, such as `http://192.168.1.10:5000` or `https://api.example.com`. |
| Preselect a default for new installs | Build with `VITE_DEFAULT_SERVER_URL=https://api.example.com`. Users can still override it in settings. |

If DevTools shows requests such as `http://localhost:5173/api/...`, that is normal in local H5 development: the browser talks to Vite first, and Vite forwards the request to `VITE_DEV_API_TARGET`.

---

## Android and iOS builds

### Android debug APK

Prerequisites: Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+, Android Studio, Android SDK, and a JDK. Android Studio's bundled JBR works as `JAVA_HOME`.

```bash
npm install
npm run cap:assets
npm run build:android
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The debug APK is written to:

```text
android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

On Windows PowerShell, use `npm.cmd` if script execution policy blocks `npm.ps1`, and set `JAVA_HOME` for the current shell if Gradle cannot find Java:

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr"
$env:Path = "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:Path"
npm.cmd run cap:assets
npm.cmd run build:android
cd android
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

### Release builds

Generate the web bundle and sync Android first:

```bash
npm run cap:assets
npm run build:android
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Release signing is intentionally not committed. Keep keystores and `keystore.properties` private, provide them through your local machine or CI secrets, and configure signing in Android Studio or Gradle before producing store builds.

### Repository policy for Android files

The `android/` project source is part of the repository so contributors can build without running `npx cap add android`. Build outputs and local machine files stay ignored:

- `android/.gradle/`
- `android/**/build/`
- `android/local.properties`
- `android/app/src/main/assets/public/` (generated by `npm run build:android`)
- `*.apk` and `*.aab`
- signing keystores and `signing/keystore.properties`

For iOS, run `npm run build:ios` on macOS, then open the native project with `npm run cap:ios`.

Capacitor documentation covers push plugins, splash screens, and store-specific packaging in detail; this README stays aligned with QuantDinger-specific wiring only.

---

## H5 deployment

1. Run `npm run build` and upload the contents of **`dist/`** to your static host root.
2. **Vue Router** uses **HTML5 history** mode. Your server must fall back to `index.html` for unknown paths, or deep links and refresh will 404.

Example Nginx pattern (adjust `server_name`, `root`, TLS, and upstream):

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name m.example.com;
    root /var/www/m.example.com;
    index index.html;

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_read_timeout 120s;
    }

    location ~* \.(?:js|css|woff2?|ttf|svg|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|webp|map)$ {
        expires 30d;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
        try_files $uri =404;
    }

    location = /index.html {
        add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate";
    }

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

Sanity checks:

```bash
curl -sI https://m.example.com/          # expect 200, HTML
curl -sI https://m.example.com/login     # expect 200 (SPA fallback)
curl -sI https://m.example.com/api/health # expect 200 via proxy
```

---

## OAuth and backend environment

For **Google / GitHub** sign-in from your **H5** domain, the QuantDinger backend must allow redirects for that origin. Typical `backend_api_python/.env` entries include:

```bash
FRONTEND_URL=https://m.example.com/login
OAUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECTS=https://m.example.com,https://m.example.com/login,https://ai.quantdinger.com,http://localhost:5173
```

Restart or rebuild the backend container after changes. If OAuth still lands on the wrong host, confirm the running image includes your latest configuration.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to check |
|---------|----------------|
| 404 on `/login` or after refresh | SPA `try_files` / equivalent missing for the static host. |
| CORS or API errors | Prefer same-origin `/api/` proxy; or open CORS on the API for your H5 origin. |
| OAuth redirect mismatch | `OAUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECTS` and `FRONTEND_URL` on the backend; rebuild/restart. |
| SSL handshake errors | Certificate chain, Nginx `ssl_protocols` (TLS 1.2+), `nginx -t`. |
| Vite says Node 20.19+ or 22.12+ is required | Switch to Node 22 LTS for this mobile repo. The desktop web repo can also run on Node 22, so one modern Node version is enough for both frontends. |
